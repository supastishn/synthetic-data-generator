Ensure this mechanism is safe for repeated pause/resume cycles and is thread-safe using standard Python threading primitives. Add comprehensive, minimal tests to verify correct pause/resume behavior and thread safety. As always, implement all changes as atomic, clear *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks*, one per file.",

The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ```\n\nUse the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.\n\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nOnly create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new files contents in the `REPLACE` section\n\nTo rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.\n\nIf the user just says something like \"ok\" or \"go ahead\" or \"do that\" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.\nThe user will say when theyve applied your edits.

Add support to time/measure the duration of each `step()` and `reset()` call, and maintain statistics: min, max, mean, and total duration for both methods separately. Provide public methods to retrieve/reset each benchmark's timing stats. Do not use any third-party timing/statistics libraries—use only Python standard modules. Add atomic, concise *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks* to the code, and extend the tests to verify accurate timing and stat tracking behavior (without relying on large sleep delays). No extra features—focus on clear code and correct *SEARCH/REPLACE* formatting in all three files.",

The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.\n2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python\n3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH\n4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code\n5. The dividing line: =======\n6. The lines to replace into the source code\n7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ```\n\nUse the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.\n\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nOnly create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new files contents in the `REPLACE` section\n\nTo rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.\n\nIf the user just says something like \"ok\" or \"go ahead\" or \"do that\" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.\nThe user will say when theyve applied your edits. If they havent explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n\nReply in english.\nONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!\n\nExamples of when to suggest shell commands:\n\n- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.\n- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.\n- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.\n- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.\n- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.\n- Etc.",

The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.\n2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python\n3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH\n4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code\n5. The dividing line: =======\n6. The lines to replace into the source code\n7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ```\n\nUse the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.\n\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nOnly create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new files contents in the `REPLACE` section\n\nTo rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.\n\nIf the user just says something like \"ok\" or \"go ahead\" or \"do that\" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.\nThe user will say when theyve applied your edits. If they havent explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n\nReply in english.\nONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!\n\nExamples of when to suggest shell commands:\n\n- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.\n- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.\n- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.\n- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.\n- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.\n- Etc.",

The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ```\n\nUse the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.\n\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nOnly create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new files contents in the `REPLACE` section\n\nTo rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.\n\nIf the user just says something like \"ok\" or \"go ahead\" or \"do that\" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.\nThe user will say when theyve applied your edits. If they havent explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n\nReply in english.\nONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!\n\nExamples of when to suggest shell commands:\n\n- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.\n- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.\n- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.\n- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.\n- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.\n- Etc.",

This mode should prompt the user (via command-line) about detected issues row-by-row or field-by-field, offering fixes (e.g. filling, dropping, changing values as recommended via data heuristics or reference distributions). Record user actions and choices in a changelog that maps each correction to the original (row, column, value), type of issue, and action taken.\n\nStructure the new code so the repair assistant is modular, and can be used standalone or invoked from other scripts.

The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.\n2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python\n3.

The closing fence: ```\n\nUse the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.\n\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nOnly create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new files contents in the `REPLACE` section\n\nTo rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.\n\nIf the user just says something like \"ok\" or \"go ahead\" or \"do that\" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.\nThe user will say when theyve applied your edits. If they havent explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n\nReply in english.\nONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!\n\nExamples of when to suggest shell commands:\n\n- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.\n- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.\n- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.\n- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.\n- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.\n- Etc.",

Each method should be callable through the dispatcher by name or task_id, and support dynamic re-routing between different dispatcher instances at runtime. Make sure task registration and routing logic are concurrency safe and fully dynamic.

I want to introduce an advanced scheduling mechanism: allow notifications to optionally be scheduled for delayed display and/or set to automatically expire (disappear) after a specified duration, all managed in Python. This should include an extensible NotificationManager class handling notification queueing, timing, and expiration. Refactor both files (using only SEARCH/REPLACE blocks) to implement this scheduling and expiration system, and update show_portal() to demonstrate scheduled and expiring notifications.
